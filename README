DESCRIPTION
If you're like me, you occasionally do a linewise yank, and then want to
insert that yanked text in the middle of some other line (or vice versa).
The mappings defined by this plugin will allow you to do a character-, line-,
or block-wise paste no matter how you yanked the text, both from normal and
insert mode.

Often, the register contents aren't quite in the form you need them. Maybe you
need to convert yanked lines to comma-separated arguments, maybe join the
lines with another separator, maybe the reverse: un-joining a single line on
some pattern to yield multiple lines. Though you can do the manipulation after
pasting, this plugin offers shortcut mappings for these actions, which are
especially helpful when you need to repeat the paste multiple times.

RELATED WORKS
- whitespaste.vim (vimscript #4351) automatically removes blank lines around
  linewise contents, and condenses inner lines to a single one. By default, it
  remaps p / P, but this can be changed.

USAGE
["x]gcp, ["x]gcP        Paste characterwise (newline characters and indent are
                        flattened to spaces) [count] times.

["x]glp, ["x]glP        Paste linewise (even if yanked text is not a complete
                        line) [count] times.

["x]gbp, ["x]gbP        Paste blockwise (inserting multiple lines in-place,
                        pushing existing text further to the right) [count]
                        times.

["x]g]p, ["x]g[P  or    Paste linewise (even if yanked text is not a complete
         ["x]g]P  or    line) [count] times like glp, but adjust the indent
         ["x]g[p        to the current line (like ]p) .

["x]g,p, ["x]g,P        Paste characterwise, with each line delimited by ", "
                        instead of the newline (and indent).

["x]gqp, ["x]gqP        Query for a separator string, then paste
                        characterwise, with each line delimited by it.

["x]gQp, ["x]gQP        Paste characterwise, with each line delimited by the
                        previously queried (gqp) separator string.

["x]gup, ["x]guP        Query for a separator pattern, un-join the register
                        contents, then paste linewise.

["x]gUp, ["x]gUP        Un-join the register contents on the previously
                        queried (gup) separator pattern, then paste
                        linewise.

["x]gpp, ["x]gpP        Paste with the first decimal number found on or after
                        the current cursor column (or the overall first
                        number, if no such match, or the last number, if the
                        cursor is at the end of the line) incremented /
                        decremented by 1.
                        Do this [count] times, with each paste further
                        incremented / decremented.

["x]gPp, ["x]gPP        Paste with all decimal numbers incremented /
                        decremented by 1.
                        Do this [count] times, with each paste further
                        incremented / decremented.

CTRL-R CTRL-C {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-}
                        Insert the contents of a register characterwise
                        (newline characters and indent are flattened to
                        spaces).
                        If you have options like 'textwidth', 'formatoptions',
                        or 'autoindent' set, this will influence what will be
                        inserted.
CTRL-R , {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-}
                        Insert the contents of a register characterwise, with
                        each line delimited by ", " instead of the newline
                        (and indent).
CTRL-R CTRL-Q {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-}
                        Query for a separator string, then insert the contents
                        of a register characterwise, with each line delimited
                        by it.
CTRL-R CTRL-Q CTRL-Q {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-}
                        Insert the contents of a register characterwise, with
                        each line delimited by the previously queried (gqp,
                        i_CTRL-R_CTRL-Q) separator string.
CTRL-R CTRL-U {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-}
                        Query for a separator pattern, un-join the contents of
                        a register, then insert it linewise.
CTRL-R CTRL-U CTRL-U {0-9a-z"%#*+/:.-}
                        Un-join the contents of
                        a register on the previously queried (gup,
                        i_CTRL_R_CTRL-U) pattern, then insert it linewise.
